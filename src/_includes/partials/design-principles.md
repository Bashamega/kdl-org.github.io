## Design Principles

1. Maintainability
1. Flexibility
1. Cognitive simplicity and Learnability
1. Ease of de/serialization
1. Ease of implementation

These are the guiding principles behind the design of KDL, in order of
importance. These principles will hopefully be useful in tie-breaking and
otherwise directing specific decisions when it comes down to it. They are
intentionally vague when it comes to specifics, but more concrete
definitions for each one will be settled on as the project matures.
