KDL is a document language with xml-like semantics that looks like you're
invoking a bunch of CLI commands!

It's meant to be used both as a serialization format and a configuration
language, and is relatively light on syntax compared to XML.

There's a living [specification](SPEC.md), as well as
[implementations](#implementations). The language is based on
[SDLang](https://sdlang.org), with a number of modifications and
clarifications on its syntax and behavior.
