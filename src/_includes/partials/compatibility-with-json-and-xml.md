## Compatibility with JSON and XML

There are two specifications for writing KDL that can be losslessly translated
between it and JSON or XML. These specifications define a stricter _subset_ of
KDL that, even if not entirely idiomatic, is still valid and fits into the
data models of the other two languages:

* [JSON in KDL](https://github.com/kdl-org/kdl/blob/main/JSON-IN-KDL.md)
* [XML in KDL](https://github.com/kdl-org/kdl/blob/main/XML-IN-KDL.md)
