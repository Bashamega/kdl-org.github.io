KDL is a document language with xml-like semantics that looks like you're
invoking a bunch of CLI commands! It's meant to be used both as a
serialization format and a configuration language, much like JSON, YAML, or
XML.

There's a living
[specification](https://github.com/kdl-org/kdl/blob/main/SPEC.md), as well as
various [implementations](#implementations). You can also check out the
[FAQ](#faq) to answer all your burning questions!

The language is based on [SDLang](https://sdlang.org), with a number of
modifications and clarifications on its syntax and behavior.
